## What is a Quickstart

* It should be a clear, concise, ordered step-by-step procedure.
* It should describe the easiest way for them to achieve a result that shows off the capabilities of your product.
* It should not delve into optimizations or advanced use cases.

## Contents of Your Quickstart

### Prerequisites
* What knowledge do I need before I begin? 
* What tasks must be completed (installation, configuring the environment?)
* Where to get tokens or API keys, etc. if needed

### The Main Body Should Follow These Guidelines.

* Start by telling users what the quickstart does. What task does this guide help the reader complete?
* It should explain the basic operations that most users perform on the site, or the operations they might perform using the API.
* Steps should be explained in the most logical order to complete a task
* Each step should contain all the information necessary to complete it. It should exclude any extraneous information.
* A step should include code samples (examples) that users can copy and paste, if executing code is necessary. Each code sample should be explained in comments that follow directly after the example, so newcomers can quickly understand how the API works.

### The Quickstart Should Not Include:

* Setup information. (This means info about everything you have to do to make your work environment compatible and ready for the API.) Sometimes setup and quickstart type information end up together in a single volume called a "Getting Started" guide (or something similar). That's not necessarily wrong, but there are advantages to keeping the two types of information separate; namely, times when users no longer need the quickstart lesson, but want the setup information to create a work environment on a new machine.
* Things that belong in the reference section, like authentication, throttling, error codes, a complete description of any feature.
* Things that belong in the overview (a general description of the product; what it can do; what it can't do)

* **Jekyll**. This SSG offers an excellent quickstart. Note that the setup info is in a separate document, but it is linked in the first step. https://jekyllrb.com/docs/
