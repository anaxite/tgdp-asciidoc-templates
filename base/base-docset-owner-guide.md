# {Doctype} customization guide

This guide describes a {doctype} document's:
* Unique characteristics,
* When to include the {doctype} doctype in a project's documentation set, and
* How [{doctype} template-set templates](../{doctype}) should be customized by a docset-owner to address a project's needs.


**Version:** {This document's version, in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format}

**Last updated:** {Date in the format: *Month DD, _YYYY* or *Month, YYYY*}

## base-template customization

TBD: Explain the unique characteristics of this section.

## base-example

The {doctype}-example.md document should describe the fictional [chronologue](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/chronologue/) project.

We've chosen to use a common example project to reduce cognitive load on the reader, and to help build a common theme between templates.

A fictional project was chosen over a real example because:
* The fictional project's characteristics can remain static over time, ensuring examples don't need to be updated.
* Characteristics can be invented to illustrate a specific feature.
* We avoid having the select a "favorite" exemplar project, and upsetting non-selected projects. 
* Examples and features can be a little whimsical, adding a little entertainment to the reading. Note, any whimsical additions should not come at the expense of legibility for the wide target audience.

The `chronologue time machine app` concept was chosen because:
* It is obviously fake.
* It is technical, and hence needs technical documentation.
* It lends itself to adding some whimsical fun.

## Best practices in writing examples

_{TBD: Capture best practices in examples here. This will likely have multiple subheadings.}_
