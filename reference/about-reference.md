# The reference article

Reference articles provide information-oriented descriptions of specific technology parts.
The purpose of reference articles is to describe the topic as consistently and accurately as possible, without mixing procedural or instructional content.

Reference articles work well when they are:

* Consistent in structure, language, and tone
* Contain descriptive information that is relevant to the reference topic's overview
* Focus on information accuracy and the facts

## Content of your reference article

### The Overview section

Summarize what the reader will achieve by reading the explanation article.

* Are you writing for developers or for managers?
* Are you writing for people who have a certain problem to solve?
* Are you writing for a particular industry or market segment?

Your overview should be descriptive of the subject you want to cover, so your audience can identify what the reference article is about.

### The Body section

The structure of reference articles vary based on the factual information you are documenting.
In most cases, reference information is easiest to express as a table.

Use the "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) method and re-use content if it's written for the same audience, and it fits within your reference document without modification.

If you need to refer to a screen in a UI, use a table to explain the fields and their meanings. Include screenshots, and use call-outs to help your audience find the field in the table.

### Code-generated documentation

Reference documentation can often be auto-generated from source code and/or comments within the code. It is typically easier to keep auto-generated docs current, accurate and complete, as the documentation is maintained next to the code it describes.
Ensure code-generated documentation is thoroughly written.
This is important for API reference docs and package descriptions documented in code doc-blocks or produced with tools such as the Open API tool chain.

If you need to provide more narrative style content to complement your API reference endpoints, see the `api-` template types in this repository.
