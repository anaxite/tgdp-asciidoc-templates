# Communications Guidelines


## Goal

The goal of the Communications Guidelines is to help project maintainers set clear expectations around project communications for users and contributors.

## Contact Us

NOTE: We expect all communications to not just follow our project Code of Conduct [LINK], but to be polite, respectful, and kind. Demanding, insulting, rude, or otherwise unpleasant communications are likely to be ignored.

#### How to file bugs or raise issues

Link to bug or issue templates here.

#### How to contribute

Link to your contributor guidelines here.

#### How to get support

If you have a support channel, an email list for users to support each other, etc. link it here.

#### How/where to ask general questions

If you have a general email list, link it here.

#### How to report a security vulnerability

Link to templates or policies here.

#### When to expect a response/how to escalate

Here are some examples:

* We try to triage new issues once a week, and respond within _x time_; we'll reply to issues in the issue comments; please don't email maintainers directly
* If you haven't received a response, before escalating, please check your spam folder/be sure that you haven't turned off notifications
* If you haven't heard back within _y time_, please (email us at @; leave a comment on the issue, etc.)
* Please be mindful that responses may be delayed over holidays or school breaks. 

## Things NOT to do

Here are some examples of 'not to dos': 

* please don't reach out directly to individual maintainers, contributors, or users on social media to ask for help, or ask them to follow you
* please don't send comments of a personal nature to other contributors or users (DMs such as "you're very handsome/pretty", "will you hire me at your company", or "do you want to chat" are not appropriate)
* if our bot closed your issue as #wontfix, please don't open a new issue unless circumstances have changed significantly

## Discussion Channels

* Channels you DO monitor, and any useful information about them, including any rules:  
	* we check StackOverflow for questions tagged _#x_ and _#y_, and try to answer reasonable questions within two weeks
	* we have a Slack/Discourse/mailing list/IRC channel, here's how to join
	* Job postings should only be put in #jobs, they will be deleted in other channels. Recruiters should not DM contributors unless they have "recruiters OK" in their profiles.

* Channels you don't monitor, or that you don't monitor regularly: 
	* Our Twitter account is announcements-only, we don't respond to Twitter DMs
	* Maintainers don't monitor Reddit, but some users are active in _r/subreddit_

Add any notes that would be helpful, for example: "Most of our maintainers are in US or EU timezones" or "We don't use @here or @all in our Slack."
