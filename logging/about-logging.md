# The logging article

## When do I need a logging article?

A logging article is a special type of template that is used only to describe log pipelines specific to your application.

This article type aligns itself closely with the reference content type, so the same content guidelines apply.

## Content of your logging article

### About the "Description" section

The description section gives the reader all the key information they need to understand what the logging entry is and how it is structured.

You complete the sections as they relate to your logs and logging pipelines.

You don't need to describe the mandatory logging parameters sent by default to the log pipeline. Define these paramaters in the higher-level reference documentation of your project.

Only describe the parameters unique to your application or common parameters that are being reused from other applications.

### About the "Logging example" section

Not having good log file examples can make it hard to debug a problem when you are on-call.

Proper description of the content in a log file can make it easier for the person on-call to solve the problem.

### About the "Log properties" section

You can specify app-specific log properties in this section.

The biggest tip for writing logging articles is to be as descriptive as possible with each logging parameter.
Think about why you would want to query this parameter in the logs and what insights or benefits the parameter adds to the log.
