# The logging article

Use logging articles to describe log pipelines specific to your application.
This article type aligns with the reference content type, so the same content guidelines apply.

## Content of logging articles

### The Description section

The description section provides key information to understand what the logging entry is and how it's structured.

Describe the parameters unique to your application, or common parameters reused from other applications.
You don't need to describe the mandatory logging parameters sent by default to the log pipeline. Define these parameters in the reference documentation for your project.

### The Logging example section

Having good log file examples makes it easier to debug problems when on-call.
Always include descriptions of the content in a log file to make it easier to solve problems.

### The Log properties section

Specify log properties in this section.
Be as descriptive as possible with each logging parameter.
Think about why you would want to query this parameter in the logs and what insights or benefits the parameter adds.
