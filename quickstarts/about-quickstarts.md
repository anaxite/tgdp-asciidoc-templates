# The quickstart tutorial template

The quickstart or `Hello World!` tutorial is for introducing your users to your product or framework for the first time. Users can typically complete these tutorials in less than 15 minutes. It's task-based and installation-focused.

## About the overview section

Use this section to provide a short description of your product and its purpose, and to describe what the user will accomplish in this tutorial.

You can also state the intended audience for your tutorial and mention any concepts users should be familiar with before starting the tutorial. 

## About the installation section

<!--link out to installation guide unless it's mostly links-->

Use this section to provide links to download your software and any other installation instructions, like how to enter a license key.

If you're writing a tutorial that's code focused, you might use this section to explain what commands users need to run from the terminal to install your product.

## Steps

The steps section is where you describe what the user needs to do. For a quickstart tutorial, you can walk the user through installing your product and then completing a small project to verify their installation.

<!--Narrative vs. procedure: pros and cons of each; pick one and stick with it-->

### Writing your steps

For each step, provide some background information about the task so users know what they're about to do and why. 

If users should see a result after completing a particular step, make sure to include it. This might mean including a screenshot of a dialog or terminal output.

## About the summary section

Use this section to summarize what tasks your user completed during the tutorial, and to summarize what your users now know how to do.
