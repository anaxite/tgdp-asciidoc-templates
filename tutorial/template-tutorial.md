# Goal
Summarise what this tutorial is about in a sentence or two. What you put here is reused in the Goal section and included in HTML description tags.

# Before you start
{Delete this section if your readers can dive straight into the lesson without requiring any prerequisite knowledge.}
Make sure you meet the following prerequisites before starting the tutorial steps:

* Prerequisite one
* Prerequisite two
* etc.

# Part 1 - <_Part Title_>

{Introduce what your audience will learn in this step, then continue to write the steps in the tutorial.
You can choose one of these approaches to write your tutorial part:

* In a narrative style if your parts are short or you are using screenshots to do most of the talking.   
* In a "Goal > Steps > Outcome" structure to build a predictable flow in all your tutorial parts.

Whatever option you choose when designing your tutorial should be carried through in subsequent parts.
}

# Part 2 - <_Part Title_>

{
Continue the design approach you chose in the previous part and continue it through to the end of the tutorial.
}

# What you've learned

{Summarise what knowledge the reader has gained by completing the tutorial, including a summary of each part's Goals (this is a good way to validate whether your tutorial has covered all you need it to.)}
