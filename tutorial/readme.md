# The Overview

### When Do I Need a Tutorial?

Tutorials are learning-oriented lessons that guide you through a series of steps to complete a project.

They are essential to give new users a feeling that they can achieve something quickly with the product or application.

Tutorial articles can often be confused with how-to articles, but you won't fall into this trap if you remember that tutorials are _learning_-oriented not _problem_-oriented.

## Content of Your Tutorial

### Who is This Tutorial For?

* Are you writing only for end-users? For developers?
* Are you writing only for people who have a certain problem to solve?
* Is it intended for a particular industry?

### Body of the Tutorial

Tutorial articles work well when they offer the following features:

* Built around specific outcomes or actions.
* Develop practical knowledge not theoretical knowledge.
* Inspire confidence by showing progress towards the tutorial goal at each main step.
* Give a feeling of achievement by giving that "small win" at each main step.
* Function on 100% on the platforms you indicate are supported.
* Exclude distractions that make your audience have to choose a path in the tutorial.

### About the "Goal" Section

Summarise the goals of your tutorial in this section.

You should write this panel *after* you have finished the article so you can summarise it properly.

### About the "Before you Start" section

Have you ever got half-way through a tutorial, only to discover you need to go and read other documentation before you can continue?
This section is designed to prevent this from happening in the first place.

Describe what the audience needs to know, or needs to have, before attempting this Tutorial.
By stating the requirements up-front, you prevent your audience from having a bad experience with your tutorial.

Here are some example Before you Start statements:

```
Make sure you meet the following prerequisites before starting the tutorial steps:

* API credentials for the {company} v3.5 API.
* Access to the Postman application.
* An understanding about what a RESTful API is conceptually.
* (Optional) A development tool (IDE) that displays API responses formatted for readability.

```

### About the Part sections

There are two ways of structuring each part in your tutorial:

* Structured
* Informal

#### Structured

The structured approach features distinct headings for each step part:

```
Part One
  Goal
  Procedure
  Outcome
Part Two
  Goal
  Procedure
  Outcome
```

This structure is great for beginners because it tells them exactly what each part will teach them, and what they should expect at the end of each part.

If your tutorial is going to be broken up into separate files, you should _absolutely_ consider this type of structure.
You should also consider this approach if your tutorial is complex and contains many procedural steps.

#### Informal

The informal approach is great for less complex (read, one-page) tutorial topics.
You can use this style when you only need to create a simple lesson with a few steps and a basic concept to teach.

```
Narrative flow
Conversational procedural structure, with a few ordered steps described in the body.
No outcome statement.
```

You get a more conversational flow with this tutorial style, however some of the prescriptive clarity is lost by not having the headings.

If you find your tutorial really only has one main procedure, consider using a `how-to` template, which you can find in this template repository.
