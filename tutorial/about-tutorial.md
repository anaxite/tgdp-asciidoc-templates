# Tutorial articles

Tutorials are learning-oriented lessons that guide you through a series of steps to complete a project.
They are essential to give new users the feeling that they can quickly achieve something with the product or application.

Tutorial articles are often confused with How Tos. Tutorials are learning-oriented, while How Tos are problem-oriented.
If you find your tutorial has a single main procedure, consider using a How To template instead of a Tutorial.

## Content of your tutorial

### The Overview section

Summarize what the reader will achieve by reading the explanation article.

* Are you writing for developers or for managers?
* Are you writing for people who have a certain problem to solve?
* Are you writing for a particular industry or market segment?

Readers should already have read a concept about the topic in an About article.
Ensure you link to the relevant About article in the overview.

### The Body section

Tutorial articles work well when they are:

* Built around specific outcomes or actions
* Develop practical knowledge, not theoretical knowledge
* Inspire confidence by showing progress towards the tutorial goal at each main step
* Give a feeling of achievement by being clear about the results of each main step
* Work as described on all the supported platforms
* Exclude distractions that make your audience have to choose a path in the tutorial

### The Goal section

Summarize the goals of your tutorial in this section.
Write this section after you have finished the article, so you can summarize it accurately.

### The Before you Start section

This section prevents readers from getting halfway through and discovering that they need to go and read other documentation before they can continue.
Prerequisites can include other articles or information to read, or it can be technical dependencies such as requiring an internet connection, or particular software.

Describe what the audience needs to know, or needs to have, before they attempt the How To.
By stating the requirements up-front, you prevent your readers from having a bad experience with your How To.
You can include links to procedures or information, or give useful pointers about how to get what they need.

For example:

```markdown
Before you begin, make sure you meet these prerequisites:

* API credentials for the v3.5 API. For more information about accessing your API credentials, see http://example.com/access_your_api_credentials.
* Access to the Postman application.
* A conceptual understanding about RESTful APIs. For more information, see http://example.com/restful_apis.
* (Optional) A development environment (IDE) that displays API responses formatted for readability.
* A list of favorites prepared, so you can manage them. For more information about favorites lists, see http://example.com/favorite_lists.

```

### The Part sections

Use either a structured style, or an informal style in this section.

#### Structured style

The structured approach features distinct headings for each step part:

```markdown
Part One
  Goal
  Procedure
  Outcome
Part Two
  Goal
  Procedure
  Outcome
```

This structure works well for beginners because it describes what each part teaches them, and what they should expect at the end of each part.

This structure also works well for tutorials separated into parts, or for complex tutorials that contain a lot of steps.

#### Informal style

The informal style is conversational, and does not include goal or outcome statements:

```markdown
Narrative flow
Conversational procedural structure, with ordered steps described in the body.
No outcome statement.
```

This structure works well for less complex tutorial topics.
Use this style for simple lessons that contain fewer steps and a basic concept.
You get a more conversational flow with this tutorial style, although it loses some of the prescriptive clarity by not including headings.
