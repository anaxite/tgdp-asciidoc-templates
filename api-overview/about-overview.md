# The overview

## When do I need an overview?

Your API documentation should include an overview document. This document tells potential users or buyers what they might want to know before adoption.

Many users install or plug into your service immediately because they are already familiar with it or someone else has decided that the team will use this solution. All of those people will go to your Quickstart, or will just get to work.

There are other groups, however, who need to assess your product in order to decide whether they want to use it. For example, managers responsible for a business decision or engineers responsible for a technical assessment of your product. People in these groups might decide to not adopt your product unless you provide an overview that answers their questions.

## Content of your overview

### Who is this overview for?

* Are you writing only for developers? For managers?
* Are you writing only for people who have a certain problem to solve?
* Is it intended for a particular industry.

### Body of the overview

Contains information that helps the developer or decision-maker get oriented to the API. Answers these questions.

* What is it supposed to do? (What problem does it solve, and for whom?)
* What exact capabilities are available to the user? What services does it offer?
* What does it NOT do that developers should know about?
* What are the typical use cases?
* How does it work? (What do users need to know about architecture an internal components?)
* What dependencies does the developer need to know about before installing?
* What technical requirements? Including development environment and licensing.
* What knowledge prerequisites does the developer need to know about before using the API?

### Postrequisites

* What comes next? Do you want to direct users to the quickstart to try it out?
* How does one get started using the API?

### Overview examples

* **Chrome Native Client**. [The Native Client Technical Overview](https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/overview) explains an engine that allows C++ to run in the browser, including why it is a good solution for engineers who want to rework a desktop app and make it usable as a web app.

* **The Jira Platform**. [This overview of the Jira Platform](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/getting-started/overview#about-the-jira-platform) does a good job of explaining multiple products and the associated use cases, uses, third-party integrations, hosting options, and licensing.
