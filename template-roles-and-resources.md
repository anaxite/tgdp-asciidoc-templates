## Template writing working groups

Our project is organized into several working groups that meet on a regular basis to work on the project’s key initiatives.
One of the best ways to get started with our project is to join and meet with one of our working groups.
See [The Good Docs Project Working Groups](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/working-group/) for a list of our current active groups.

If you are a first-time contributor, you are required to join a template writing working group as you work on your first template project.

The working groups that are specifically devoted to template writing are:

- [Community Docs](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/working-group/community-docs/)
- [EMEA-APAC Templateers](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/working-group/emea-apac/)

> :triangular_flag_on_post: **NOTE: As a template writing working group grows, it might need to be broken up into smaller groups. When separate groups should be formed will be left to the discretion of the template mentor leading the group, but the general recommendation is no more than 5-6 participants.**
